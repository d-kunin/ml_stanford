Hi,
My name is Tamir and I’m working at the marketing department in Widdit.
My goal is to spot attractive apps and expose the developers to our new SDK, The HomeBase.
Android developers use different SDKs in order to maximize their revenue and you are about to be exposed to the most profitable one!
 
Here is a brief explanation about our SDK:
Our SDK creates a custom lock screen and increases monetization and engagement for android apps.
Revenue Share model.
We are going to pay you as long as your users have your app (they don’t have to use your app, just to have it). 
The biggest advantage – we are fully compliance with Google’s new policy.
Unlike most SDKs, We are adding value to the end users (we don’t want them to be mad ;), We give the users a very cool lock screen that makes their use more fun and interesting.

The SDK is fully customization so you have the option to add anything you think that can help you promote your apps or other things your users might love, your decision…
Of course there is no problem to run it with other existing SDKs simultaneity.
 
All you left to do is register to our HomeBase and let your apps make big money for you!!!!! Just sit and watch how your revenue is increasing day by day!!!!
 
What do you think? Sounds good? Please contact me for additional information!
 
Best regards,
